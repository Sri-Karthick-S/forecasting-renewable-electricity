Using Time series models(ARIMA and SARIMA) to forecast renewable energy production in Australia

# Dataset: Monthly Renewable Electricity Production in Australia (2010–2025)
- The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the International Energy Agency (IEA) through their publicly available Monthly Electricity Statistics. It covers monthly renewable electricity production data for Australia from January 2010 to February 2025, measured in Gigawatt-hours (GWh). The selected product is Total Renewables, which aggregates electricity production from hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, and other renewable sources.
- **Source**: Monthly Electricity Statistics (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/monthly-electricity-statistics)
- **Research Question**: How has Australia’s renewable electricity production evolved over the past decade, and what do forecasts for the next 10 months suggest about future trends?
